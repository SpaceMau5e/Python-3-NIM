# Python-3-NIM
The game of NIM made in Python 3.

Purpose: Resume

How to Play:

The game of NIM is simple, you start by selecting if you want to go first or second, then depending on which you pick either you will be asked to take peices or the computer will. When its your turn you are asked to take 1, 2, or 3 peices with the goal being to be the player who takes the last game peice on their turn. 

How it works:

The code behind it is simple, when the program is run it will asked the user if they wish to configure the game which allows them to set the number of game peices that will be used, afterwards they can pick to be player 1 or player 2. The game will then start and run through a game loop when the plyer will take a turn and then the computer will. The computer is programmed with a mathmatical formula which allows it to calcuate the best move to make on its turn but this formula does not guarantee a win as the player can out smart it with some strategy.

Based on the mathmatical game NIM: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#:~:text=Nim%20is%20a%20mathematical%20game,the%20same%20heap%20or%20pile.
